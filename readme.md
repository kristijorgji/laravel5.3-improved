This is an empty project with user roles, email confirmation and redirects set for you. 
Just follow these steps to get it started

1. run "composer install" in your project directory to get all dependencies
2. run "php artisan migrate" to create all the necessary tables for setting up user and roles
3(optional). run "db:seed" to add 2 roles and 1 admin user that I have created in the seed files
4. use your .env file, put correct email settings and database settings
